# 🩺 Health AI: Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict diseases based on symptoms provided by the user. Designed for easy use through a radio button interface on Google Colab, it helps simulate health diagnostics using AI.

## 📌 Features

- Symptom-based disease prediction
- Clean and interactive radio button interface (Google Colab)
- Uses scikit-learn models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Visual analytics for better understanding
- No local installation required

## 📂 Project Structure

```
├── Health_AI.ipynb        # Main Jupyter notebook (designed for Google Colab)
├── README.md              # Project description and usage instructions
```

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Google Colab
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 How to Use (Google Colab)

1. Open the notebook on Google Colab:  
   [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. Run all cells in order.

3. Use the interactive **gradio button interface** to:
   - Select symptoms
   - Predict disease outcome

4. View prediction and model accuracy in output cells.

## 🧠 Model Workflow

- Load and clean dataset
- Perform train-test split
- Fit model (e.g., Decision Tree)
- Make predictions based on selected symptoms
- Display prediction results interactively

## ✅ To-Do

- Improve UI using Gradio or Streamlit
- Connect to real-world medical data APIs
- Support multi-symptom selection
